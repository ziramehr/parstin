# About Pārstin
Pārstin is the name proposed by Iranian Astrophysicist and Linguist Dr. Mohammad Heydari-Malayeri for an alternative writing system for the Persian language (Pārsi), resembling the Latin script. It has several advantages over the current script which is adapted from Arabic, most importantly, it's precision in capturing Pārsi. Moreover, Pārsi is an Indo-European language which means that it has more similarities with Latin than with Arabic. 
This writing system was explained by Iranian Philosopher and Translator Dr. Mir Shamsuddin Adib-Soltani in An introduction to the writing of the Persian script. Amirkabir Publications, Tehran, 1976. A summary of it is available in the below infographic thanks to Dr. Heydari-Malayeri.
