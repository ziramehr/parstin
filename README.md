# P훮rstin
P훮rstin is the name proposed by Iranian Astrophysicist and Linguist Dr. Mohammad Heydari-Malayeri for an alternative writing system for the Persian language (P훮rsi), resembling the Latin script. It has several advantages over the current script adapted from Arabic, most importantly, it's precision in capturing P훮rsi.
This writing system was explained by Iranian Philosopher and Translator Dr. Mir Shamsuddin Adib-Soltani in An introduction to the writing of the Persian script. Amirkabir Publications, Tehran, 1976. A summary of it is available below thanks to Dr. Heydari-Malayeri.
