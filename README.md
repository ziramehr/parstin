# parstin
Pārstin is the name proposed by Iranian Astrophysicist and Linguist Dr. Mohammad Heydari-Malayeri for an alternative writing system for the Persian language (Pārsi), resembling the Latin script. It has several advantages over the current script adapted from Arabic, most importantly, it's precision in capturing Pārsi.
This writing system was explained by Iranian Philosopher and Translator Dr. Mir Shamsuddin Adib-Soltani in An introduction to the writing of the Persian script. Amirkabir Publications, Tehran, 1976.
